# Functional Programming, Fun of a Higher Order

## Yay Math!

Functional programming is built on the idea that functions in programming should
behave like functions in mathematics. f(x) = x + 2 will always return 4 when
provided the argument 2.  That predictability is not to be underestimated!

## Keep It Pure

Keep your hands off my state!  Mutation may work for evolution but it ain't
gonna fly here...

## First Class Fun

Functions can be arguments!  Let's leave our for-loops behind and explore some
higher order functions (ie. functions that take functions as arguments) that are
built in to JavaScript's Array!

### Filter

Do you need all the evens in a list of integers?  Or would you like to sort
through some records to find the ones that pass a certain test?  Filter is the
method for you.
[//]: # (whosBlue.js)

### Map

What about transformation?  Perhaps we have a list of records but we need to
change their shape to fit our API.  When we want to apply a function to every
item in a list we MAP it, yo!
[//]: # (nameFuse.js)

### Reduce

Are you feeling the power?  We're just getting started!  When we want to take a
list and turn it into some other object (or we just want to be really fancy), we
use the reduce method.
[//]: # (reductoAdAbsurdium.js)

## More Resources

Whew!  That was overwhelming!  My favorite way to practice and learn functional
programming is to practice in languages that force you to be functional!

- [Functional Programming in Erlang](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/functional-programming-erlang/)
  - Loving this course right now.  Erlang is one of my favorite 'weekend'
    languages and this course is a great intro to functional programming!
- [Elm Tutorial](https://www.elm-tutorial.org/en/)
  - Elm is a funky front end language that compiles to JavaScript and appealed
    to me because of the following billing: 'Even if you don't like it, you'll
    be a better React programmer because of it!'
- [Introduction to Haskell](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis194/fall16/)
  - Are you looking to impress people with your knowledge of Monads? No? Well,
    you should look up Haskell anyway!  It is PURE as PURE gets in programming
    and there are great resources out there to get you started.  Writing Haskell
    will change your brain, for realz.

  - It's mostly just me posting links but I'd love to help you through any of
    the material posted here, or help you get rid of those gauche for-loops!
